## 📦 Installation

Require the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require artflow-studio/scanner --dev
```

The package will automatically register its service provider.

### Publish Configuration (Optional)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=scanner-config
```

This creates `config/scanner.php` where you can customize the scanner behavior.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Interactive Scan (Recommended)

Run the interactive scanner to select which checks to perform:

```bash
php artisan scan
```

This presents a beautiful menu to choose from 17 scanners with real-time progress updates.

### Scan Everything

Run all 17 scanners at once:

```bash
php artisan scan --all
```

### Individual Scanner Commands

Run specific scanners for targeted analysis:

```bash
# Core Security Scanners
php artisan scan:livewire           # Livewire component security
php artisan scan:security           # XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, dangerous functions
php artisan scan:rate-limit         # Rate limiting on routes
php artisan scan:authentication     # Auth & session security
php artisan scan:dependencies       # Outdated/vulnerable packages

```

### Auto-Fix Vulnerabilities 🤖

Automatically fix detected issues with intelligent repair strategies:

```bash
# Dry-run mode (preview changes without applying)
php artisan scan:fix --dry-run

# Fix specific scanner issues
php artisan scan:fix --scanner=livewire --dry-run

# Fix specific vulnerability type
php artisan scan:fix --type=public_property_no_validation --dry-run

# Auto-fix with backup (recommended for first run)
php artisan scan:fix --backup --auto

# Interactive mode (asks for confirmation)
