---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. ParserFactory API Update ✅
**File**: `src/Analyzers/CodeAnalyzer.php` (Line 17)
- **Issue**: Outdated API call to `ParserFactory::create()`
- **Solution**: Updated to `createForNewestSupportedVersion()`
- **Impact**: Critical - Required for AST parsing

### 2. Regex Pattern Correction ✅
**File**: `src/laravel-securitys/LivewireScanner.php` (Line 109)
- **Issue**: Incomplete character class in regex pattern
- **Solution**: Fixed pattern closing bracket
- **Impact**: High - Validation detection was broken

### 3. Method Name Corrections ✅
**Files**: 
- `src/Reports/ConsoleReport.php` (Line 54)
- `src/Reports/HtmlReport.php` (Line 135)
- `src/Reports/MarkdownReport.php` (Line 74)
- **Issue**: Called non-existent `getDescription()` method
- **Solution**: Changed to `getScannerDescription()`
- **Impact**: Critical - All report generation was failing
